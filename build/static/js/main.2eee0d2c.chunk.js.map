When she looked at today compared to yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she couldn't see how anything was ever the same.\r\n      He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.\r\nThe wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. It had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n      <p>The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the mother Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack.\r\n      MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There was something that made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She really didn't care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.\r\n      I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase \"meant to be.\" That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that \"meant to be\" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.\r\n      There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She couldn't stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn't stand which topped all of them combined.\r\n      If you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall, with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man, you'll have a rough idea of what they looked like -- except for their teeth. The canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger, and showed at the corners of their wide, thin-lipped mouths, giving them an expression of ferocity.\r\nEating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. \"It's a delicacy in Japan,\" didn't seem to make it any more appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not.</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It's better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends. All things in moderation.\r\n        Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as needed. But don't make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon. It'll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind. They can serve a variety of purposes, from decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them.\r\n        He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time.\r\n        The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.\r\n        \"What is the best way to get what you want?\" she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?\r\nThey argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n      <p>Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.\r\n      He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.\r\n      Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to explain this to the others?\r\n      The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and didn't have a choice.\r\nHopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;\r\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport function useKey(key) {\r\n    // Keep track of key state\r\n    const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false)\r\n\r\n    // Does an event match the key we're watching?\r\n    const match = event => key.toLowerCase() == event.key.toLowerCase()\r\n\r\n    // Event handlers\r\n    const onDown = event => {\r\n        if (match(event)) setPressed(true)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const onUp = event => {\r\n        if (match(event)) setPressed(false)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Bind and unbind events\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        window.addEventListener(\"keydown\", onDown)\r\n        window.addEventListener(\"keyup\", onUp)\r\n        return () => {\r\n            window.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", onDown)\r\n            window.removeEventListener(\"keyup\", onUp)\r\n        }\r\n    }, [key])\r\n\r\n    return pressed\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default useKey;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport useKey from '../functions/keyEvents';\r\nimport PieChart from 'react-simple-pie-chart';\r\n\r\nconst ands = (a, b, c) => a && b && c\r\n\r\nfunction Extrapage() {\r\n  const rKey = ands(!useKey('r'), !useKey('g'), !useKey('b'))\r\n  const gKey = ands(!useKey('r'), useKey('g'), !useKey('b'))\r\n  const bKey = ands(!useKey('r'), !useKey('g'), useKey('b'))\r\n  return (\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>She didn't understand how changed worked.
